    		<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				Windows is the de-facto choice for gamers playing on the PC. This is because
				most games are available only on Windows. As of September 1st 2021, Steam has
				a total of 55,808 games. All of these games has a windows port. 24% (13,143) of
				these games has a MacOS port and 15% (8,482) of these has a Linux port.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you are non-Windows user. You are missing approximately 70% of the games already
				on Steam. Mind you, Steam is one of the few stores that supports Windows, macOS and Linux. 
				The second one is GoG. There are couple of games out there that are not available on Steam 
				such as Epic and Origin exclusive games, both stores are Windows and MacOS exclusive stores.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even so, most of these Epic and Origin exclusive games are Windows only anyways. Linux 
				and MacOS can play some of these Windows exclusive via Wine (and Steam's implementation of Wine, Proton)
				however not all games work with it (specially Multiplayer games) which makes it not enough as a solution.
			</p>
			<p>
				Many people have considered using virtual machines as a possible solution for this problem. Thus in the
				next following section, we will discuss in great detail the possibility, viability, and pros & cons of 
				playing games in a virtual machine.
