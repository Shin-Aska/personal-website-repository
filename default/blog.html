                In his experiment, he used both Firefox and Chrome, mostly in their default setups.
                My approach, however, is a bit different. Let’s dive into how I’ve managed to open

                Instead of using Prime95, why not use something else as a
                means to stress test? Is BSNES a reliable way to stress test
                your machine? Let us find out.

                In this article, I am sharing my insights on an
                <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html"
                  >article</a

                written by Madaidan, who is a lead developer of Whonix.
                where in the said article is discussing the security
                problems Linux has and are those concerns enough
                for someone to stop using Linux as their daily driver.
