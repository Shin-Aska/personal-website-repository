        Hi, it seems that the browser you're using is not compatible with my
        site. Either because it's too old or you're using one of the following
        browsers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Brow.sh - Terminal based browser that attempts to render a modern web
          using ssh
        </li>
        <li>
          Lynx - Text based browser. The oldest browser that is still active in
          development!
        </li>
        <li>w3m - Text based browser. Quite popular too</li>
      </ul>

        More importantly, I got you :-), Here is a backwards compatible version

      <h1>Is GNU/Linux really insecure?</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Among all the operating systems out there, GNU/Linux is one of those
        that have a very interesting history. This is because unlike other
        operating systems that started out of a commercial effort, GNU/Linux
        started and has remained as a community effort stemming from the Free
        and Open Source (FOSS) philosophy where source code of a software is
        available for everyone and everyone has the liberty to modify the
        software and redistribute them for whatever purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now going back to computer security, there is a reason why Linux quickly
        dominated the server space. This is not because Linux has a superior
        architecture nor Linux offers best security but simpler than that. It
        won the server space because it is modifiable and accessibile.
      </p>
      <p>
        There might not be a financial incentive for somebody to host their own
        server if they had to purchase a Windows Server license just so they can
        host their website, but if the operating system was free and we have a
        replacement of the server-side scripting language bundled with Windows
        Server then that changes things. There is a reason why the popularity
        between
        <a
          href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=US&q=Linux"
          >Linux<sup>[1]</sup></a
        >
        and
        <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=PHP"
          >PHP<sup>[2]</sup></a
        >
        worldwide from 2004 to 2009 are similar in Google trends. This is not a
        coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        GNU/Linux was never there when it comes to computer security but I would
        not say either that it sucked because back then and even to this day
        <b>all desktop operating systems sucks</b>
        in a computer security perspective. Quite possibility the reason why
        Linux got such a reputation in computer security is possibility because
        of the myths that surrounded it such as
        <b>Linux does not have viruses'</b>,
        <b
          >'Linux code is open for everyone to read; therefore is audited;
          therefore is secure'</b
        >, <b>'Majority of the servers are running in Linux'</b> and etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        I could go on and on with the examples but more importantly, Is the sky
        really falling? should we be worried about security concerns in
        GNU/Linux? Let us discuss the valid points Madaidan has brought in the
        table from his
        <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html"
          >article</a
        >

      <h2>Sandboxing</h2>
      <h3>"Linux still follows the MS-DOS security model"</h3>

      <p>
        A rogue application on Windows and macOS can still scan a user's
        document directory and can still download a victim's data (Even an
        innocent teamviewer session has the potential to do this). You might
        argue that on Windows and macOS users are warned about unsigned
        binaries, while true that Linux does not do that (because it is useless
        to do so) it is a non-problem on major Linux distributions because Linux
        desktop users are encouraged to use package managers, app stores
        maintained by Linux distros, Flathub and Snapcraft instead of running
        random binaries on the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ofcourse I'm not discrediting Apple's App store and Windows store which
        is also a solution for not encountering rogue applications and having
        the apps distributed on their stores sandboxed. The main point here is
        that Yes,
        <b
          >Linux might still follow the MS-DOS security model but so are the
          other two major desktop operating systems</b
        >. As for sandbox, all apps distributed under Flatpak and Snapd are
        sandboxed by different security modules. Whether or not Flatpak and
        Snapd have inferior sandbox implementations is up for a different
        discussion.
