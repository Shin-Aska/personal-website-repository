			<h1 id="headingBlog">Why I Switched to Podman (And Why You Should Too)</h1>
			<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
			<p>I first discovered Podman back in 2022. It was listed as one of the supported engines for <b>Distrobox</b>, a tool I was experimenting with at the time. Back then, I was a dedicated Docker user. While I was vaguely intrigued by Podman's "daemonless" nature, I didn't feel a pressing need to switch.</p>
			<p>I subscribe to the philosophy: <i>"If it works, don't fix it."</i> Docker was working for me or so I thought.</p>
			<p>My perspective changed when I moved from building simple, small container images to complex, multi-layered ones. I began hitting friction points that turned my workflow into a headache, eventually forcing me to look for a better alternative. That alternative was Podman.</p>
			<h2 id="the_problem_with_the_docker_daemon">The Problem with the Docker Daemon</h2>
			<p>The cracks in my Docker workflow appeared during heavy build processes. I encountered a situation where a build failed because my disk reached capacity. In a perfect world, this should just stop the build.</p>
			<p>However, with Docker, this triggered an unrecoverable state in the storage driver. Because Docker relies on a central daemon (a background process that manages everything), when that daemon struggles to write layers to a full disk, it can corrupt the state of the engine. I wasn't just left with a failed build; I was left with a corrupted installation that required me to completely purge my Docker data and rebuild everything from scratch.</p>
			<p>This highlighted a critical architectural flaw: <b>The Single Point of Failure.</b></p>
			<p>If the Docker daemon crashes or corrupts, every container it manages goes down with it. It felt fragile.</p>
			<h2 id="the_podman_difference_native_linux_architecture">The Podman Difference: Native Linux Architecture</h2>
			<p>This led me to seriously investigate Podman. The immediate "lifesaver" feature was its <b>daemonless architecture</b>.</p>
			<p>Unlike Docker, which uses a client-server model (the CLI talks to a long-running Daemon), Podman works like a traditional Linux command (fork/exec). When you run `podman build`, it is just a process running under your user.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Stability:</b> If a Podman build crashes due to a full disk, only that specific build process dies. My other running containers are unaffected.</li>
				<li><b>Safety:</b> There is no central daemon to corrupt. If the build fails, the cleanup is usually immediate and isolated.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In a native Linux environment, this performance is raw and direct. There is no middleman. Podman interacts directly with the kernel's <b>cgroups</b> and <b>namespaces</b>, making it incredibly efficient for system resources.</p>
			<h2 id="podman_on_windows_escaping_the_"_docker_tax"">Podman on Windows: Escaping the "Docker Tax"</h2>
			<p>You might be thinking, "This sounds great for Linux, but I use Windows."</p>
			<p>While both Docker and Podman utilize <b>WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2)</b> to run containers on Windows, the way they package this experience is vastly different.</p>
			<p>Docker Desktop on Windows bundles the WSL2 backend inside a heavy, commercialized application. It runs a resource-intensive GUI and background services that can eat up significant RAM even when idle.</p>
			<p>Podman, on the other hand, offers a cleaner approach for Windows developers:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><b>No Licensing Headaches:</b> This is the most critical difference. <b>Docker Desktop</b> requires a paid subscription for larger organizations (companies with over 250 employees or $10M in revenue). Podman is strictly open source (Apache 2.0). You can deploy it across your entire engineering team without worrying about compliance audits or procurement costs.</li>
				<li><b>Lightweight Integration:</b> Because Podman doesn't force a heavy UI layer (unless you explicitly install Podman Desktop), it often feels lighter on system resources. It leverages the Fedora-based WSL2 backend strictly for the engine, keeping your development environment snappy.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="simplified_management_the_power_of_auto_update">Simplified Management: The Power of Auto-Update</h2>
			<p>One of my favorite use cases for containers is hosting <b>Neko</b>, a virtual browser running inside a container. It’s excellent for testing web applications or browsing potentially unsafe sites in an isolated environment.</p>
			<p>In the Docker world, updating Neko was a chore:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Stop the container.</li>
				<li>Remove the container.</li>
				<li>Pull the new image.</li>
				<li>Re-run the container with the exact same flags as before.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If you manage a fleet of services, this becomes tedious very quickly.</p>
			<p>Podman introduces a game-changer called <b>Auto-Update</b>. By integrating with `systemd`, I can simply run:</p>
			<pre>
				<code class="language-bash">
podman auto-update

				</code>
			</pre>
			<p>Podman checks if a new image is available, pulls it, restarts the container, and even supports <b>automatic rollback</b> if the new container fails to start. It turns a 10-minute maintenance task into a background process I don't even have to think about.</p>
			<h2 id="security_by_design">Security by Design</h2>
			<p>Finally, we must talk about security. Docker has historically suffered from vulnerabilities related to its root-privileged daemon. For example, <a href="https://www.cve.news/cve-2025-3224/">CVE-2025-3224</a> was a vulnerability where an attacker could potentially execute code with root privileges because the Docker daemon runs as root.</p>
			<p>Podman mitigates this entirely through two mechanisms:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Daemonless:</b> There is no persistent root process waiting to be exploited.</li>
				<li><b>Rootless by Default:</b> Podman is designed to run containers as a non-root user.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>While Docker now supports "Rootless Mode," it is often difficult to configure. Podman works rootless out of the box.</p>
			<h3 id="how_it_works_under_the_hood">How it Works Under the Hood</h3>
			<p>Technically, Podman interfaces directly with the Linux kernel's <b>cgroups</b> and <b>namespaces</b>. This adheres strictly to OCI (Open Container Initiative) standards, making it highly secure, compliant, and lightweight.</p>
			<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
			<p>I didn't switch to Podman just to be a contrarian. I switched because it treats containers the way they were meant to be treated: as standard Linux processes, not as children of a monolithic server.</p>
			<p>We are past the era where we need a daemon to hold our hands. If you value stability, security, and open-source freedom, the question isn't "Why switch to Podman?" it is "Why are you still paying for Docker?"</p>
