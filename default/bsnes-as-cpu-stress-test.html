      Hi, it seems that the browser you're using is not compatible with my
      site. Either because it's too old or you're using one of the following
      browsers:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Brow.sh - Terminal based browser that attempts to render a modern web
        using ssh
      </li>
      <li>
        Lynx - Text based browser. The oldest browser that is still active in
        development!
      </li>
      <li>w3m - Text based browser. Quite popular too</li>
    </ul>
  </canvas>

      More importantly, I got you :-), Here is a backwards compatible version
      that is designed to work on older browsers

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/bsnes-emu/bsnes">BSNES<sup>[1]</sup></a> is a popular SNES emulator that is well known for
      being the most accurate emulator out there. Meaning its
      the best emulator that you can use if you have an SNES
      game that doesn't work properly on your daily emulator.
      However such feat comes with a cost, specifically it requires
      a very powerful machine inorder to run the games on this 
      emulator at a 60hz speeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      CPU Stress testing is the act of purposely running your
      computer at very high loads <i>(almost at 100%)</i>
      to test for hardware defects for newly purchase machines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Normally you run <a href="https://www.mersenne.org/download/">prime95<sup>[2]</sup></a> or <a href="https://www.ocbase.com/">something similar<sup>[3]</sup></a> for an hour
      and leave your computer there and come back and check if
      your computer is doing fine. <i>(If it restarted, turned off 
      or the program crashed is a good indicator something is
      wrong with your hardware and if its newly bought item
      you can probably return it to the manufacturer)</i>
    </p>

    <h2>The setup</h2>
    <p>
      BSNES at it default settings can run on a decent mid-range
      computer now. Originally it needs a CPU that has 3ghz speed
      but with the optimizations made throughout time, it can run
      on something like a Macbook Air (2015). Although you have to 
      understand that when using this emulator, it is expected that 
      it will hog all of your CPU cores.
