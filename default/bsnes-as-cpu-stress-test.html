      Hi, it seems that the browser you're using is not compatible with my
      site. Either because it's too old or you're using one of the following
      browsers:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Brow.sh - Terminal based browser that attempts to render a modern web
        using ssh
      </li>
      <li>
        Lynx - Text based browser. The oldest browser that is still active in
        development!
      </li>
      <li>w3m - Text based browser. Quite popular too</li>
    </ul>

      More importantly, I got you :-), Here is a backwards compatible version

    <h1 id="headingBlog">Using BSNES as a fun way to stress test your machine</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/bsnes-emu/bsnes">BSNES<sup>[1]</sup></a> is a popular SNES emulator that is well known for
      being the most accurate emulator out there. Meaning its
      the best emulator that you can use if you have an SNES
      game that doesn't work properly on your daily emulator.
      However such feat comes with a cost, specifically it requires
      a powerful machine inorder to run the games on this 
      emulator at a 60hz speeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      CPU Stress testing is the act of purposely running your
      computer at very high loads <i>(almost at 100%)</i>
      to test for hardware defects for newly purchase machines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Normally you run <a href="https://www.mersenne.org/download/">prime95<sup>[2]</sup></a> or <a href="https://www.ocbase.com/">something similar<sup>[3]</sup></a> for an hour
      and leave your computer there and come back and check if
      your computer is doing fine. <i>(If it restarted, turned off 
      or the program crashed is a good indicator something is
      wrong with your hardware and if its newly bought item
      you can probably return it to the manufacturer)</i>
    </p>

    <h2>Making sense of things</h2>
    <p>
      BSNES at it default settings can run on a decent mid-range
      computer now. Originally it needs a CPU that has 3ghz speed
      but with the optimizations made throughout time, it can run
      on something like a Macbook Air (2015). Although you have to 
      understand that when using this emulator, it is expected that 
      it will hog all of your CPU cores (which will guarantee that
      your CPU will be always at 95%-ish). The only exception for this
      is if you're using the retroarch bsnes core performance version.
    </p>
    <a href="images/bsnes-sample.jpeg" target="_blank"><img class="preview center" src="images/bsnes-sample.jpeg"></a>
    <p>
      When playing any game in BSNES, it is designed that it will consume
      all of your CPU cores regardless of the game. BSNES does offer
      additional things that other emulators cannot do such as HD Mode 7
      but thing here is you do not even need it for it to consume 95%-ish
      of your CPU cores. It will consume it at that much amount regardless.
    </p>
    <p>
      To not go into full detail, this is because BSNES is designed to be cycle 
      accurate emulator. Where every SNES component was emulated to match exactly
      how it responds, how many seconds it takes to process an input and etc.
      Side effect of this is it requires a rather strong machine although these days
      modern computers can handle these emulators that wasn't possible a decade ago. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In other words, it consuming 95%-ish CPU cores while its running is a side-effect
      of it being accurate. This is because the emulator wants the whole machine to dedicate
      itself to the emulator for the sake of fast context switching responses (Afterall the
      more processes running, the more the Operating system has to divide its attention to
      accomodate the other programs) and other bits.
    </p>
    <h2>The Setup</h2>
    <p>
      Since we now understand why BSNES acts the way it does and in a way it makes sense
      without digging to much into the technical details. We will now go with what we will
      be having to do CPU stress test upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said that a Macbook Air (2015) can run BSNES fine and this is absolutely true. Running
      games in there can go as 95% as average. But we will not be going to that route. Instead
      I will be using my main PC that has a Intel core i9 9900k @ 3.6GHZ. On this test I capped
      turbo boost to be only until 4Ghz because for temperature control reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the emulator ROMs, I have an SNES Mini, so I <a href="https://github.com/TeamShinkansen/Hakchi2-CE">decided to get my ROMS from there</a> but
      you can just search over the internet for Free SNES ROMs dumps and that should work fine
      as well too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that I have the games set, I will be stress testing my unit for an hour. With that in mind
      I will be playing the following games.
      <ol>
        <li>Super Mario Kart (With Mode 7 support it, there's no problem)</li>
        <li>Super Mario World</li>
        <li>Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island</li>
        <li>Donkey-kong Country</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h2>The results and practical use</h2>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, I ended up way more than an hour for test due to being too much entertained to care.
      No problems where found and the system was infact very stable running at 63c during its peak CPU usage.
      That being said its not really suprising since I have built this main PC for quite some time now so
      it should've passed already the test (and not to mention, it has been stressed test before too)
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the question comes in mind that why would I ever use this when there is SNES9X or Retroarch BSNES
      performance core? I'll throw that question back by asking the opposite. "Why not"? Any unused CPU core
      is to be honest a waste. It's not also like that you're overclocking the system for it to decrease its lifespan.
      You're just using your computer at its best for the sake of emulation accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Practically speaking, you may want to use this knowledge and bring yourself a set of ROMs and BSNES packed in a USB drive
      and probably a USB gamepad (I recommend 8Bitdo SF30) when buying a new prebuilt computer or laptop and ask if you can test 
      the machine. Ofcourse a harmless SNES emulator shouldn't really cause a flag on them and it is always nice to see the defect 
      while you're on the store rather than bringing it home and doing this only to find out something is wrong with it.
