    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      A decade ago, there were only a handful of native Linux AAA games available in the market. The only native AAA
      game that I can remember back then was Amnesia, and the rest were indie games where the majority are fairly new
      and are made under the FOSS license where most development are done as a hobby.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tuxkart for example was not that visually appealing back then as most of the development was focused on solidfying
      gameplay and furthermore Wine was still at its infancy that time and can only run old games at best. Thus many
      have form an opinion that Linux is not really meant for gaming.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <a href="images/tuxkarto.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="preview center" src="images/tuxkarto_tmb.jpg"></a>
      <figcaption>Figure 1. Tuxkart version 0.6</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Now jump back to the present; a lot of things have happened. Most of the indie FOSS license games have become
      mature. Tuxkart development ended and a fork continued on its place called SuperTuxKart which is now known as a
      solid racing time-killer game now that anyone can get for free and is visually appealing too. Did I forget to
      mention it has network multiplayer and upto 4-player splitscreen.
    </p>

      <a href="images/tuxkart.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="preview center" src="images/tuxkart_tmb.jpg"></a>
      <figcaption>Figure 2. SuperTuxkart version 0.9.2. Massive difference in both functionality and graphics
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Then Wine is finally started catching up. It is now able to run a huge amount of Windows applications that it can
      run than ever before and alot more developers have started contributing to the project which made it possible for
      newly released Windows applications to start working on Wine. Not to mention since all of these projects are under
      FOSS, there are efforts to port these projects to other operating systems as well which is a win-win for everyone.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because of Wine's maturity and potential. Valve saw the opportunity to streamline Wine to Steam and developed
      Proton (which is basically an integrated Wine on Steam) for Linux. They even have a documentation for developers
      to port their games over to Linux via Proton. This in turn allowed Valve to open more games to Linux users. (Case
      in point; I was able to even play Resident Evil 3 and Trials of Mana on Day 1!)
    </p>

    <figure>
      <a href="images/re3_1_wine.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="preview center" src="images/re3_1_wine_tmb.jpg"></a>
      <figcaption>Figure 3. Resident Evil 3, playable on release via Proton</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Although Trials of Mana did require installing Mediaplatform framework to fix the crashing issues (which is a bit
      difficult to do for a beginner) and Resident Evil 3 was not finishable during the first few versions of Proton.
      Eventually <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases"> Custom Proton
        builds<sup>[1]</sup></a> came in and added their own custom fixes so that these issues are fixed on that
      particular Proton build.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is far from perfect and these types of issues are normal as the Wine community as a whole is playing the
      catchup for creating unofficialy compatibility layer for Windows applications. However as you can see as well, The
      community along with Valve is actually doing their work pretty great and is quite fast in most cases (There are
      cases where it takes awhile due to technical limitations, like it took awhile for them to finally implement
      support for PE ntdll.dll, which is what the Street Fighter 5 DRM required to be playable)
    </p>
    <p>
      I know why you are here though. I or somebody else linked you to this article in hopes to get more details
      regarding the state of Linux gaming and is considering on switching or going-all in on Linux possible. I will not
      try to convince you however but I will discuss the technical achievements accomplished on what allowed for Linux
      gaming to become what it is today, in 2021.
    </p>
    <h2>Overall State of Wine</h2>
    <h3>Existence of superior graphical translation layers</h3>
    <figure>
      <a href="images/hw_render.drawio.png" target="_blank"><img class="preview center"
          src="images/hw_render.drawio.png" style="width: 100% !important"></a>
      <figcaption>Figure 4. Architecture diagram of how Wine translated a Direct3D call
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      In order for DirectX games to run on Wine. There is a translation layer needed as DirectX is a technology
      exclusive to Windows only. For example Wine translates Direct3D calls to OpenGL calls. This isn't really the best
      approach as Direct3D and OpenGL are fundamentally different. Thus there are cases were performance is slightly
      impacted because of how OpenGL has to adjust itself in-order to comply with the translated Direct3D call. (The
      same case is also applicable in DirectDraw but it translates DirectDraw calls to Xlib calls instead, which
      performance penalty is probably non-existent as one can program xlib calls that are on-par or better than the
      DirectDraw call).
    </p>
    <p>
      As OpenGL specifications improve overtime, the performance penalty should also reduce as it has newer features
      that are
      on-par with the required Direct3D features. However there has been two translation layers that appeared lately
      that changed the Linux gaming for good.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are Gallium9 and DXVK. Gallium9 is a native implementation of D3D via Mesa. This removes the extra step of
      translating D3D calls to OpenGL calls as most of the GPU calls are done directly at a driver level which provides
      a significant
      amount of performance improvement.
    </p>
    <p>
      DXVK is another approach where instead of relying on Mesa, it translates D3D calls to Vulkan. Vulkan is designed
      to access
      the raw hardware power of a GPU in contrast of OpenGL which is simplified, so there is more potential of writing a
      faster
      translation layer in Vulkan over OpenGL. DXVK is designed to support D3D as a whole (Originally only supporting
      DX10 and 11 but
      DX9VK is now part of DXVK which in turn allowed DXVK to support DX9 as well) While Gallium9 is exclusively for
      D3D9.
    </p>
    <p>
      These new translation layers are far from perfect however it allows room for more games in Linux than ever
      before at slightly less performance impact. However just like the introduction story earlier. It will improve and
      mature overtime allowing more software to be ran on Linux and possibly other platforms as well.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <a href="images/rendering_issue_megaman_2.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="preview center"
          src="images/rendering_issue_megaman_2_tmb.jpg"></a>
      <figcaption>Figure 5. Rendering issue for Megaman Legacy Collection 2 due to DXVK incorrect translation
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      For example, this DXVK issue was fixed on a later version and MMLC2 is now playable on Linux but there will be
      games (or
      future newer titles) that will encounter issues similar to this.
    </p>
    <h3>Mediaplatform support</h3>
    <p>
      Media Foundation/DirectShow/Media Platform are APIs provided by Microsoft to be able to embed rich user media such
      as videos (for cutscenes), audio in a variety of formats, including those under encryption via DRM.
    </p>
    <p>
      Originally the potential fix for this is to install Mediaplatform (Mfplat) on your targetted Wine prefix, and it
      might work (Since there is still software that refuses to run even with this type of hack). Not to mention we are
      treding a thin-ice/grey area here because of the implicated legality in Microsoft's EULA, it is not legal to
      provide this level of support out of the box and the user is left on their own to apply this
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting in Wine 6.0, we now have decent Mediaplatform support out of the box using clean-room reverse engineering
      efforts. This is great because that means there are alot of games that will work out of the box (including
      cutscenes)
    </p>
    <h3>DRM Support and Anticheat</h3>
    <p>
      These are some of the real problems that Wine is facing right now. Many software, especially under the AAA game
      section, have DRMs and anti-cheats that are incompatible with Wine. This is a problem because certain DRMs and
      Anticheats directly use the NT Kernel instead of interacting with the Win32API.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Wine is a translation layer of Win32API calls to GNU/Linux calls, now when software running on Wine will
      attempt to do a system call on the NT Kernel, Wine will let the software communicate with the Linux Kernel. Since
      the Linux kernel does not understand what the system call does, it will provide back an incorrect response or
      respond at all causing the DRM module or Anticheat to fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, there are many ways to fix this; currently, Wine developers will translate the NT Kernel calls without
      sending a system call directly to the kernel. This is not necessarily bad, but custom Wine forks started to appear
      to make a specific game and DRM compatible with Linux.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Linux Kernel 5.11, there is now syscall_user_dispatch which basically lets the kernel send back unsupported
      system calls back to userspace which will help alot standardizing this effort. This is not the silver bullet but
      it should help make things manageable now without having thousands and thousands of forks popping in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valve is making efforts to provide better Proton support for DRMs, especially for single-player games by nature.
      However, for Anticheat/Multiplayer games, we are still out of luck. So if you are playing a multiplayer game using
      Easy Anticheat, such as Fall guys, where the game was playable on Day 1 but became incompatible because the Easy
      Anticheat integration caused it to fail on Linux users.s.
    </p>
    <h3>Overall Compatibility</h3>

    <figure>
      <a href="images/teso_1_wine.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="preview center" src="images/teso_1_wine_tmb.jpg"></a>
      <figcaption>Figure 6. Elder Scrolls Online, a playable MMORPG on Proton despite being a Windows only game on
        Steam.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Naturally, one will think that the latest version is always the better one. But because of updates that happen on
      each version in an effort to fix existing issues or increase software compatibility, it is also natural that it
      will break existing application compatibility. This is why certain applications/games are recommended to be ran on
      a specific Wine version.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thankfully it is possible to have multiple versions of Wine installed in a user's system. Thanks to launchers such
      as Lutris and Play on Linux, they have existing configurations that allows you to run/install applications with
      minimal effort in the user's end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not to mention Steam also allows you to run and configure to use specific versions of Proton (including Custom
      Proton forks such as Proton-TKG and Proton-GE) in a per game basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      So to sum it all up, Wine compatibility has been doing great. But it is not yet on the level of super user
      friendliness yet. Even with Valve's proton, one may end up applying hacks or installing custom Proton builds in
      order to make a game run. With WineHQ and ProtonDB, there is a global database of what runs and what does not and
      what hacks are needed for a program to run properly. But if you do not like this type of setting, I'm afraid Linux
      is not for you yet.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
      Honestly, for me, I do admit it can be a hassle, but still the trade off here is that I have more control
      with my computer. There is no need for me to accomodate and install powerful hardware just because of the
      Windows bloat that later versions of Windows has.
    </p>

    <p>
      I do not need to worry that while I am playing a game
      suddenly the game turns to a crawl because for some reason the telemetry & compatibility service decides
      to do its own thing competing resources with the game I am playing.
    </p>

    <p>
      I mean sure, you can do unofficial tweak Windows to the point where these bloat are entirely removed but there are
      c
      onsequences in here. For one, it is unsupported, thus, updates can make or break the tweak or the entire system as
      a whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      So for me, I would rather go for Linux which has less bloat in general (or no bloat at all) and just tweak the
      translation layer until it could support the game well enough to be playable on the said system.
    </p>

    <h2>State of Native games</h2>
    <figure>
      <a href="images/eve_1_wine.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="preview center" src="images/eve_1_wine_tmb.jpg"></a>
      <figcaption>Figure 8. EverSpace - One of the games that has a native Linux port</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Despite Wine being the main spotlight in Linux gaming lately (due to its opening a lot of games from Windows),
      there has been increasing traction of Linux compatibility, especially on the Indie section. Not to mention that
      have been online games too that slowly added native Linux support.
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples are Valheim and Skul the hero slayer; both are popular games right now.
    </p>
    <h3>The rise popularity of AppImages</h3>
    <p>
      If Windows has static linked executables, MacOS has standalone executables, Linux has AppImages. AppImages are
      like standalone executables. You don't have to install it on the system; you can just run it after downloading it.
      All the necessary files are pack in a single container. No need to install dependencies; it just works.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been seeing a lot of companies supporting it lately, such as Artix Games using AppImages on their Game
      Launcher, OnlyOffice distributing AppImages. This is great because developers do not want to adopt Linux due to
      its fragmented ecosystem, and now AppImage is one of the solutions for that.
    </p>
    <h4>Flatpak and Snap, the other answers</h4>
    <p>
      These are other answers of software distribution. Flatpak and Snap are somewhat similar, although they differ in
      technicalities. Both of them provide a software storefront and deploy images in an isolated sandbox including all
      the needed dependencies similar to AppImage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The key difference between Flatpak and Snap is what sandboxing protocol it is using. Flatpak uses Namespaces while
      Snap uses AppArmor. Redhat mainly develops Flatpak while Snap is Canonical.
    </p>
    <p>
      Snap has the most hosted applications among the three, but some applications are not hosted in Snap but are
      available in others such as Flatpak or AppImage.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <a href="images/frogatto.jpeg" target="_blank"><img class="preview center" src="images/frogatto_tmb.jpeg"></a>
      <figcaption>Figure 9. Frogatto - One of the indie games available on several Linux distro repositories for free
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      That being said, AppImages, Flatpak, and Snap are just means for developers to effectively distribute their
      applications outside of using package files that may end up different per Linux distribution due to dependency
      conflict issues. For example, I am using Ubuntu 18.04.5 and will be staying here until 2023, but the glibc library
      I am using is far lower compared to what 20.04 offers, which will be alot of trouble on applications that require
      a higher version of glibc.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the said methods above, I do not need to worry about it anymore. I do not need to worry about breaking old
      software compatibility since I do not need to force myself to customize my Ubuntu 18.04.5 even further to use a
      newer version of glibc!r to use a newer version of glibc!
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, there are a lot of applications already distributed using either of the three. Snap has been the most
      common one, and Flatpak being the second. AppImages vary since there is no consolidated storage or front for it (I
      know AppImageHub exists) thus, it is left to the developer to distribute their app using AppImage.
    </p>


    <h2>Should I make the switch?</h2>
    <p>
      Now the real question. Should you? If your current setup is working fine, then you should not. It is not worth the
      hassle. I will only recommend switching if they have something they dislike from Windows or they are considering
      Linux because they are building a new machine and do not want to spend money on an extra windows license.
    </p>


    <p>
      If you are not an online gamer however and you want less bloat, then you may want to take a look and venture it
      (if you have the time and willing to spend time tinkering to make it work) however for online gaming. If your game
      does not have a native linux client and is well known not to work properly then I would suggest sticking with
      Windows instead.
    </p>

    <p>
      The reason is because most likely you are playing well established games already and as I discussed earlier with
      related to Wine and Anticheat compatibility. It may not work. However if you are quitting a game you may find
      yourself that there are handful of games out there that might suite your interests while also being playable on
      Linux due to either it being having a native Linux client or the client is compatible with Proton. Here are
      examples of games that I play right now.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
      As you can see, these are commercial games that you can play on Linux right now. Not to mention these are native
      games but there are also Proton games that will work too like the Elder Scrolls Online I gave as an example
      earlier. It really boils down to whether you want to explore the world of Linux or not (as some chose not to
      because they thought it is not a viable platform to which I have demonstrated here that it is)
    </p>

    <h2> Update: July 5, 2021 (Provided video recordings in a form of links)</h2>
    <p>
      As of this writing, I have bought in a total of three newly released games on Steam. These are: Guilty Gear
      -Strive-, Scarlet Nexus and Legends of Mana. These games do not have native Linux ports and since I mainly game on
      Linux it was purely a risk in my end.
    </p>
    <p>
      To my surprise, Guilty Gear -Strive- worked out of the box on day 1. It has some issues like movement
      demonstration videos not playing but the core game including multiplayer worked great! <a target="_blank"
        href="https://youtu.be/indGn-UrroU"><sup>[YT]</sup></a> <a target="_blank"
        href="videos/linux_proton_strive.mp4"><sup>[LC]</sup></a> Scarlet Nexus too worked on day 1 and did not show any
      issues at all <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/TS9y05EK2FY"><sup>[YT]</sup></a> <a target="_blank"
        href="videos/linux_proton_scarlet.mp4"><sup>[LC]</sup></a>. Legends of Mana actually ran and was able to play
      for the first few minutes but is considered unplayable because it freezes randomly every so often (probably due to
      Denuvo) <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/Pru0qSgH1yA"><sup>[YT]</sup></a> <a target="_blank"
        href="videos/linux_proton_lom.mp4"><sup>[LC]</sup></a>. To be fair, the steam port for Legend of Mana is a bit
      of problematic anyways due to it having slow down issues that the PS4 and Switch versions do not have.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a Resident Evil fan, I did not purchase nor tried out Resident Evil 8 (Village) [because Resident Evil 7 is
      still in my backlog]. Although I am aware of its history in terms of playability status in Proton. Originally it
      did not play well because of Denuvo (which was apparent on the demo) but for a couple of weeks later, the Proton
      community was able to forge in a patch to make the game playable hence obtaining the Gold rating now. I mean as
      long as its a very popular game, eventually somebody is bound to be able to fix the underlying issues of Wine to
      be able to make the game playable.
    </p>
    <h2>Update: October 11, 2021</h2>
    <p>
      Valve has recently been in contact with Anticheat and DRM companies and make an appeal start supporting Wine and in 
      turn Proton for their upcoming Steam deck hardware which resulted in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690670/epic-eac-anti-cheat-linux-valve-steam-deck-support-games">
      Epic Games adding an expansion roadmap for supporting Proton and Wine while BattleEye promises to have it support on its way<sup>[2]</sup></a>.
      So that issue I said above where we are out of luck with anticheat support? It seems like this is no longer the case.
