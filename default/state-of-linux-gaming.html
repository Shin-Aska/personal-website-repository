      Hi, it seems that the browser you're using is not compatible with my
      site. Either because it's too old or you're using one of the following
      browsers:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Brow.sh - Terminal based browser that attempts to render a modern web
        using ssh
      </li>
      <li>
        Lynx - Text based browser. The oldest browser that is still active in
        development!
      </li>
      <li>w3m - Text based browser. Quite popular too</li>
    </ul>

      More importantly, I got you :-), Here is a backwards compatible version
      that is designed to work on older browsers

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Gaming in Linux has been a really interesting topic on the Linux circle lately
      due to the immense progress that has been made for the past couple of years. 
    </p>
    <p>
      A decade ago, there where only a handful of native Linux triple A games such as
      Amnesia, Valve games such as Half Life and portal and hundreds of indie native 
      Linux games such as Frogatto, Tux games (SuperTux and Tuxcart) and Wine was still
      at its infancy but very promising (so much so that it can even run Starcraft 2!)
    </p>
    <p>
      Now jump back to present, alot of things happened. OpenGL was always a bit inferior
      compare to DirectX in terms of performance. Then AMD invested in FOSS laying their
      Mantle API to the FOSS community and Vulkan was born. Not to mention AMD opensourced
      their drivers too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vulkan made alot of things possible. Such as DXVK and VKD3D. Originally Wine had
      great compatibility with DirectX9 and lower games. However since newer games where
      using DirectX10, DirectX11 and DirectX12. It was thought to be difficult for Wine
      to catch up with the newer iterations of DirectX. With DXVK, DirectX10 and DirectX11
      games became a reality and VKD3D became the solution for the new DirectX12.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition Vulkan allowed more room for native Linux game because it was cross-platform
      specification in constrast to DirectX which was Windows only.
    </p>
    <p>
      We already knew for quite awhile now that Valve went all in on Linux. This started first
      with their games but they even created Proton which is a Wine compatibility layer for 
      Steam to allow to play Windows games on Linux! Because of this move, Valve opened alot
      of games to Linux users. (Case in point; I was able to even play Resident Evil 3 and 
      Trials of Mana on Day 1!)
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of Proton as well, we started to have a flood of Wine forks aiming to be compatible
      to a specific software/game which is always a great news to Linux fans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now with such a very long introduction, the question now is. How good is Linux gaming? Are we
      there yet? In the next section I will discuss what we have, the challenges we have and what
      we may never get.
    </p>
    <h2>State of DXVK</h2>
    <p>
      Despite Microsoft pushing everyone to DirectX12 and DirectX12 becoming the norm for newer games.
      Alot of developers are still using DirectX11. DXVK is still at its infancy stages. For sure there 
      are alot of games already DXVK supports such as the ones I mentioned earlier, Resident Evil 3, 
      Trials of Mana, in addition, Control and Death Stranding. Should be mentioned that these games are 
      not even a year old yet!
    </p>
    <p>
      Very promising as it may be, it still has alot of stuff that needs fixing. For example only just
      recently (DXVK 1.8) where was it possible to play Megaman Legacy Collection 2. Originally you had
      rendering problems/issues as seen below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basically this means that not all games will run properly yet but eventually it will.
    </p>
