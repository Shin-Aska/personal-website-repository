		<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			Browser-based games had such a unique evolution. Started out as games with no visual update on the game
			world;
			if you wish to get updates on what is happening in the game, you have to manually refresh the page or
			interact
			within the game so that the page refreshes on some sort.
		</p>

		<figure>
			<a href="images/basic-browser-horz.png" target="_blank"><img class="preview center"
					src="images/basic-browser-horz_tmb.png"></a>
			<figcaption>Figure 1. Sigmastore and Kingdom of Loathing. Browser based games that follows the old browser
				formula.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>
			Examples of these designs are still present in several modern browser games, such as Kingdom of Loathing and
			Sigmastorm, as seen in the figures above. In the Kingdom of Loathing, it shows iframes to separate different
			UI
			elements. You interact with game elements using hyperlinks where each link corresponds to a user action (of
			course, they are neatly hidden in images to make them presentable).
		</p>

		<p>
			Once the interaction is made, the page refreshes. This is also similar to Sigmastorm, but instead of the
			interactable
			elements be done on game objects wrapped on a hyperlink. The game is represented in a grid instead; if you
			want to move, you click on the arrows in the map; if you're going to interact with what that current tile
			has to
			offer, you click on the links available in the location details.
		</p>

		<p>
			Each action will refresh the page in some way, shape, or form. Sometimes it does not have to be the entire
			page,
			just like in Kingdom of Loathing's case, where iframes are instead updated. It is a pretty interesting
			trick,
			but such designs are limiting for game designers.
		</p>

		<p>
			In contrast, non-browser games are usually detailed and offer live visual updates on what is happening in
			the
			game world without user interaction. The closest one you can have with such a design is to install an auto
			page
			refresher on your browser.
		</p>

		<p>
			Then here comes browser plugins such as Flash Player, Shockwave, Java applets, etc. These plugins offered
			something that browsers normally do not. It extended the features of what the browser can do with the
			requirement that these plugins must be installed to make these pages work.
		</p>

		<p>
			Shortly, games like Club Penguin, Habbo Hotel, Runescape, and Drakensang started popping out of nowhere,
			offering the same experience downloaded MMOs have but right before your browser. Of course, they are not as
			detailed as their downloaded counterparts because of space and internet bandwidth issues, but the fact that
			they
			can be accessed as long as the plugin is installed was good enough to spread gaming to the masses.
		</p>

			<figcaption>Figure 2. Adventure Quest Worlds - One of the popular browser MMORPGs out there powered by Flash
				player
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>
			However, a paradigm shift from browser plugins started around 2013-2014. The movement began when Steve Jobs
			initially rejected Flash player on iPhone in 2011. The tech sector has been working aggressively after that
			to
			replace Flash player with something more native and built-in within the browser.
		</p>

		<p>
			As browser-plugin applications started to die out in favor of the native ones available within a browser, so
			did
			the browser plugins themselves. But browser games were mainly still developed in Flash as it was the most
			dominant platform to create games until the death of Flash was finally settled around January 12, 2021, when
			most browsers stopped using plugins.
		</p>

		<p>
			With such a long introduction, the question now is. With the evolution of browser games from native to
			plugin
			back to native. How far has it come? Did the shift away from plugins do good for browser-based gaming? Or
			did it
			cause a significant hit to the browser-based ecosystem? Let us discuss.
		</p>

		<h2 id="death_of_flash">Death of Flash player</h2>

		<p>
			The death of Flash was long announced. Before its announcement, everyone in the tech sector had witnessed
			the
			evolution of HTML as it slowly replaced and acquired the unique features of these browser plugins. It was
			already speculated that sooner or later, plugin support would cease to exist for the browsers, and thus, it
			was
			discouraged from creating applications relying on the browser plugins.
		</p>

		<p>
			Browser-based applications that relied on those plugins have already planned to move out from them in favor
			of
			either utilizing HTML's current new features or becoming a downloadable application. In the former's case,
			one
			example is Habbo Hotel which offered both a downloadable client and an HTML5 client, while the latter is
			Runescape, which went into a standalone client.
		</p>

		<p>
			Other good examples of games that transitioned away from Flash player to HTML5 are Facebook games such as
			Candycrush, TetrisBattle, and Farmville. Initially, these versions used to be powered by Flash player but
			slowly
			transitioned to HTML5.
		</p>

		<h2 id="new_era">The new era of browser games</h2>

		<p>
			Now that HTML5 is the only way moving forward to play browser games. It did pave the way to things that were
			not
			imagined before, such as Web assembly. Web assembly introduced speeds on web-based applications that were
			not
			available there back. A good example is two MMORPG browser-based MMORPGs, Flyff Universe and Genfanad.
		</p>

		<figure>
			<a href="images/flyff.png" target="_blank"><img class="preview center" src="images/flyff_tmb.png"></a>
			<figcaption>Figure 3. Flyff Universe - an HTML5 port of the same MMO game released in 2004</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>
			Flyff Universe is an HTML5 port of an old MMORPG named Flyff. But this one was ported via web assembly, and
			assets are downloaded and cached on the fly. Flyff Universe is basically an improved version of the
			original. It
			even introduces graphical techniques not in the original, such as Render-scaling, advanced shader effects,
			and
			longer render distance. The performance of Flyff Universe is very impressive. Even a 2015 Macbook Air can
			play
			this game without issues.
		</p>

		<p>
			The performance of Flyff Universe is very impressive. Even a 2015 Macbook Air can play this game without

		</p>

		<figure>
			<a href="images/genfanad.png" target="_blank"><img class="preview center" src="images/genfanad_tmb.png"></a>
			<figcaption>Figure 4. Genfanad - a new browser based game from an indie company</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>
			On the other hand, is Genfanad. It is a new browser MMORPG inspired heavily by the first version of
			Runescape,
			Runescape Classic. It features 2d sprites for characters and NPCs and a 3d environment. A hybrid 2d and 3d.
			This
			one is written purely using JavaScript.
		</p>

		<p>
			Although the graphics are not as complex as Flyff, the same MacBook Air struggles to play the game in even
			20fps. I only get 15 fps, even in a noncrowded area. This goes to show how great web assembly is in terms of
			performance. Game developers wishing to create complex scenery can rely on web assembly to speed up their
			process.
		</p>

		<p>
			What is great about web assembly is you do not need to learn web assembly. You can use an existing language
			such
			as C/C++ or Rust and use their compiler to compile it to wasm code. Thanks to this, HTML5 ports of games
			such as
			SuperTux2, FreeCiv, Doom, and even Ragnarok Online are possible with minimal effort (no need to rewrite an
			engine from scratch).
		</p>

		<p>
			Actually, you don't even have to go that far. Unreal Engine and Unity, for example, can output game projects
			to
			wasm. The former relies on plugins, while the latter is built-in.
		</p>

					src="images/speed_racing_pro_tmb.png"></a>
			<figcaption>Figure 5. Night City Racing - a HTML5 racing game that was developed in Unity and exported to
				Unity
				Web
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>
			As the figure above shows, game developers can develop graphically sophisticated games from a well-known
			game
			engine and export them easily to HTML. Really impressive how far we have come in game development. Allowing
			us
			to deliver games on a variety of platforms.
		</p>

		<h2 id="list_of_recommended_games">List of my recommended browser based games</h2>

		<p>
			There are tons of browser-based games out there. So take this list as my recommended picks instead of being
			like
			the absolute best browser games out there. I mainly play downloaded games, with a few notable exceptions. So
			I
			may have missed some great browser games that I am not aware of that exists.
		</p>

		<p>
			Additionally, these lists are mainly multiplayer ones. So if you are looking for a single-player
			browser-based
			game, this list is not for you. Mind you, some of these games may have an offline/play with AI feature, but
			they're mainly multiplayer games.
		</p>

		<p>
			I also omit browser-based games not officially ported or endorsed by their intellectual property owner.

		<h2 id="finale">Ending notes</h2>

		<p>
			As you can see, you can get entertained even in the new era of browser-based games. Certainly, the shift of
			these games away from plugins paved the way for unique implementations that were not possible before.
		</p>

		<p>
			For example, Flash may have been a dominant platform for developing browser-based games, but it was limited
			in
			what it could do. Although later in Flash's life, it could render in 3D. There were better platforms to
			create
			3D games on.
		</p>

		<p>
			I remember that even if Flash could do 3D rendering, the hardware acceleration aspect was unavailable across
			all
			operating systems. This means certain games are not playable when played on Mac or Linux. Not to mention the
			availability of the plugin it needs as well.
		</p>

		<p>
			Of course, it was Flash, Adobe Shockwave, and Oracle Java. Shockwave was superior in 3D games but was less
			well
			known because of management decisions. Frankly, it was true that Shockwave games were mostly slow to load
			because it packed more assets for players back then to download, but it could push more stuff than Flash.
		</p>

		<p>
			On the other hand, Java applets are in the same competition league as Shockwave but are more popular. And by
			I
			mean the same league, was able to pack sophisticated 3d graphics right in your browser. Part of the reason
			people do not remember Shockwave is because of poor leadership reasons. However, based on experience,
			Shockwave
			was far more popular than Java applets for games.
		</p>

		<p>
			So imagine, if you want to play a couple of browser games back then, you not only have to install Flash
			player,
			but also possibly Shockwave and Java too. Not to mention these plugins had limitations. Like Flash player
			being
			limited in what it can do with 3d, Shockwave being locked down to Windows only, or Java being difficult to
			program games with in general because if you want to appeal to a larger set of userbase, you have to
			optimize
			the game. This is why Runescape originally had to load in regions, where when a player reaches the edge of a
			region, it loads the next closest region and unloads the currently loaded one.
		</p>

		<p>
			The creation of WebGL and Webassembly paved the way for possibilities that were not there before. Being able
			to
			port full pledge games right in front of your browser. This is an interesting thing to consider as these
			technologies allow the distribution of games regardless of Operating System.
		</p>

		<p>
			So what can I say? The shift away from plugins certainly did good for browser gaming in general. Although it
			was
			sad to see a lot of these great games go. There have been <a
				href="https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/">archiving
				projects <sup>[1]</sup></a> that aim to restore these plugin-based games to a playable state, and for
			that, I am
			grateful.
		</p>

		<p>
			Especially some of these games that were restored have had their micro-transaction shop revived with
			everything
			free in it. Which I find very, very cool.
		</p>

		<h2 id="update_feb_11_2024">Update: February 11, 2024</h2>

		<p>
			I have removed Genfanad from the list because the game has been taken down in favor of revamping the game's
			combat and turning it into a card game.
			However I did add three new games to the list. They are Hordes.io, Astodud and Assault Bots. They are a
			MMORPG, a platformer and a shooter game respectively.
		</p>

		<h2 id="update_may4_2024">Update: May 4, 2024</h2>

		<p>
			I have replaced AstroDud with Stumbleguys. Stumbleguys is cross platform but has an HTML5 version which I
			find not only cool but better. You play against more
			players while offering more content
