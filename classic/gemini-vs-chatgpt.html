			<h1 id="headingBlog">Using ChatGPT vs Gemini</h1>
			<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
			<p>I recently participated in a company hackathon where the challenge was to create a work-related system incorporating AI. My goal was to develop a deep learning neural network for a new feature in our system. Since the feature was new, we needed to generate training data. Given the tight three-day timeframe, we utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce thousands of data points, which we then manually pruned.</p>
			<p>During this data generation phase, my colleagues and I had a productive discussion comparing ChatGPT Plus and Gemini Pro. I've been using ChatGPT Plus for several months, but a friend suggested that Gemini Pro might be better suited for our development and coding tasks. This conversation sparked an idea.</p>
			<p>Why not try Gemini Pro for a month and see how it performs? After all, I'm always looking for ways to streamline my work, and if switching LLM providers can enhance my productivity, I'm willing to give it a shot.</p>
			<p>In this article, I will share my experience using Gemini Pro for one month and compare it to my experience with ChatGPT Plus. I conducted this experiment while my ChatGPT Plus subscription was still active (until June 10), which allowed me to make a direct comparison between the two platforms before transitioning exclusively to Gemini Pro.</p>
			<p>Before we begin, though, I am quite aware of other LLM providers such as Anthropic, and I have actually tried them in the past as well. Although the claim that one LLM produces better code than another is subjective, I do not primarily use LLMs to generate entire codebases, but rather just snippets when needed. I mostly use LLMs at work to proofread what I have wrote, or to generate or convert code from one format to another (such as converting JSON data to a Mermaid Diagram), so I will be reflecting on my experience based on that.</p>
			<p>Granted, I also use ChatGPT for a little creative work. Specifically, for generating avatars from an old-school game I play named Fallen Sword, and occasionally to help friends create 10-15 second videos for their Dungeons & Dragons scenarios. I will also include these creative features that the two offer in my comparison.</p>
			<h2 id="code_generation">Code Generation</h2>
			<p>I use LLMs quite extensively, from bootstrapping drafts from bullet points for a proposal to converting one piece of code to another.</p>
			<p>For instance, I tend to use LLMs to ease my visualization work, where I convert JSON into a UML class diagram.</p>
			<p>I do this by sending the LLM anonymized JSON data resembling what I want to visualize, then ask it to convert this to MermaidChart syntax, and then make small edits to adjust it to what I want to present to my peers.</p>
			<p>To make my example more concrete, here is a sample JSON I anonymized:</p>

			<p>This JSON data contains multiple nested fields, and some of them even go three levels deep. In my testing, I usually have fewer problems with Gemini than with ChatGPT. I did not fully test every model but only tested with the models that have the highest level of reasoning available: Gemini 2.5 Pro and o3 from ChatGPT.</p>

			<p>Gemini got most of it correct, as seen in the figure above, although it had problems interpreting the content within <b>extras_rca1</b> of <b>rules_collection_A</b>. For instance, Gemini somehow conveniently dropped <b>keywords_rca1</b>. If it were me, I would create two objects to represent the differing structures for <b>extras_rca1</b> and then wrap them in a <b>Union</b> clause.</p>

			<p>In contrast, ChatGPT started to get confused with the <b>MediaCollectionA</b> part. It created an unrelated class called <b>int</b> (I'm not sure where it got that from), and then it also mishandled <b>ExtrasRCA1</b>, much like Gemini.</p>
			<p>Comparing the two, I usually need fewer edits with Gemini, if any at all. Most of the time, Gemini gets it right, but there are also cases where I need some back and forth with both LLMs.</p>
			<p>Mind you, I also tested researching code with an LLM, and based on my experience, the two are mostly the same in that department. My process involves searching for features (sometimes on a search engine), receiving feedback from the LLM, and then engaging in some back-and-forth before I do my own cross-checking to ensure its output is not a hallucination.</p>
			<p>In that regard, both ChatGPT and Gemini are fine. I did not test vibe coding for the two, nor do I do vibe coding, but overall, in my use case of diagram conversion, Gemini comes out on top.</p>
			<p>Lastly if you are wondering why I put my experience of diagram conversion in code generation it is because Mermaid is a code as a chart. In an essence what I am doing is just the same task as creating simple code.</p>
			<h2 id="image_generation">Image Generation</h2>
			<p>I use image generation quite extensively, often to create avatars for a text-based game I play or for forum-based games like Fallensword. When it comes to pure base-to-image generation, I find the two to be equal.</p>
			<p>Using this prompt:</p>
			<pre style="text-align: left !important;">
				<code language="text">
Generate a new image
Create an image of a warrior, with magical artifacts, that just came back from an adventure and now visits back the king. The king must be at the back of the warrior and the warrior must be the center of the image.
The king is very far back
Add also audiences at the side, must be royal members of the castle

				<figcaption>Figure 1. Image Generation of my current Avatar in Fallensword only using Text</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>However, Gemini lacks the ability to refine its previous image generations, whereas ChatGPT is very good at it. This gap is more obvious when modifying non-AI images and having the AI reimagine them. For example, I might want to reimagine a personal photo of mine in a Studio Ghibli style.</p>

			<p>You can even give ChatGPT mockups or wireframes of what you want to do with a detailed description and often times it ends up close if not exact with what you want it to be.</p>

			<p>ChatGPT itself cannot generate videos. For that, OpenAI offers a separate portal for image and video generation called Sora. Sora is actually very good; it has the same ability to use existing images as context, so you can do a lot with it.</p>
			<p>I have reimagined a Studio Ghibli-style photo and animated it for everyone's entertainment. In other cases, the avatars I generated for the games I play ended up being animated (saved as APNGs).</p>
			<p>However, there is one thing Gemini does (via its Veo engine) that Sora cannot: it can make characters speak. <a href="files/domain_expansion.mp4">This can lead to very interesting sketches, as you can write a prompt that includes a person's dialogue and have them act it out.</a></p>
			<p>Although I haven't tested this feature extensively, I did generate a few videos for a laugh with my friends. For example, we were discussing AI video generation when another friend tried to hijack the conversation by talking about the peach jam she was making. As a creative way to steer the discussion back on topic, I prompted Gemini, <a href="files/peach_jam.mp4">"A woman creating peach jam and saying, 'I created a peach jam using fake videos,'"</a> which led to a funny eight-second clip.</p>
			<p>I can imagine it being used for a movie or a short cutscene, although I did notice it's terrible for non-realistic videos—but then again, so is Sora.</p>
			<p>That being said, the ability for characters in Gemini's videos to speak is very good, and for that, I will say Gemini comes out on top on this one.</p>
			<h2 id="writing_assistant">Writing assistant</h2>
			<p>I use LLMs to revise or proofread what I've written, and I have been doing this for quite some time in situations such as writing emails or blog articles.</p>
			<p>There are also cases where I ask an LLM to generate proposals for me from just bullet points. This is especially useful when someone asks for something as soon as possible, but I can't write it out at that moment. I can dictate the points via voice, have the AI generate a draft, and then just read it over once to make any revisions.</p>
			<p>For this task, I even created a specific project on OpenAI, but I often find that the "Gem" I created with Gemini (their equivalent to OpenAI's GPTs) performs better for my use case.</p>
			<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Basing on my findings, I can say that Gemini seems to be the better AI for my use cases. It is better at coding, video generation and as a writing assistant. However even though Gemini performs better, I will not say that ChatGPT is terrible at it, afterall I have been using ChatGPT pro for quite some time now (almost a year to be exact).</p>
			<p>Honestly, I wish I could have both, but due to budget constraints, I've decided to stick with Gemini. I will certainly miss the better image generation from ChatGPT, but aside from the better performance for my work use cases, I also get 2TB of storage bundled in. For me, that's quite a steal.</p>
