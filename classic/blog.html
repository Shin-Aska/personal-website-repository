                Although LibreOffice is the common default office suite on many
                Linux distributions. Some are looking for a better alternative for a variety of reasons. 
                Is LibreOffice enough? Are there better alternatives? Let us discuss.

                Many have asked if playing games in a virtual machine is a worthwhile
                experience. Let us explore this question with the technology we have in 2021.

                Unfortunately Microsoft went
                with a new gimmick for this version by
                implementing hardware requirements for
                the first time. What is Microsoft planning
                to achieve? Is it worth it to upgrade
                hardware just so you can use Windows 11?
                Let us discuss.

                Instead of using Prime95, why not use something else as a
                means to stress test? Is BSNES a reliable way to stress test
                your machine? Let us find out.

                written by Madaidan, who is a lead developer of Whonix.
                where in the said article is discussing the security
                problems Linux has and are those concerns enough
                for someone to stupid using Linux as their daily driver.
