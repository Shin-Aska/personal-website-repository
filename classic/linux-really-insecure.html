			<h1>Is GNU/Linux really insecure?</h1>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
			  Among all the operating systems out there, GNU/Linux is one of those
			  that have a very interesting history. This is because unlike other
			  operating systems that started out of a commercial effort, GNU/Linux
			  started and has remained as a community effort stemming from the Free
			  and Open Source (FOSS) philosophy where source code of a software is
			  available for everyone and everyone has the liberty to modify the
			  software and redistribute them for whatever purposes.
			</p>
			<p>
			  Now going back to computer security, there is a reason why Linux quickly
			  dominated the server space. This is not because Linux has a superior
			  architecture nor Linux offers best security but simpler than that. It
			  won the server space because it is modifiable and accessibile.
			</p>
			<p>
			  There might not be a financial incentive for somebody to host their own
			  server if they had to purchase a Windows Server license just so they can
			  host their website, but if the operating system was free and we have a
			  replacement of the server-side scripting language bundled with Windows
			  Server then that changes things. There is a reason why the popularity
			  between
			  <a
				href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=US&q=Linux"
				>Linux<sup>[1]</sup></a
			  >
			  and
			  <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=PHP"
				>PHP<sup>[2]</sup></a
			  >
			  worldwide from 2004 to 2009 are similar in Google trends. This is not a
			  coincidence.
			</p>
			<p>
			  GNU/Linux was never there when it comes to computer security but I would
			  not say either that it sucked because back then and even to this day
			  <b>all desktop operating systems sucks</b>
			  in a computer security perspective. Quite possibility the reason why
			  Linux got such a reputation in computer security is possibility because
			  of the myths that surrounded it such as
			  <b>Linux does not have viruses'</b>,
			  <b
				>'Linux code is open for everyone to read; therefore is audited;
				therefore is secure'</b
			  >, <b>'Majority of the servers are running in Linux'</b> and etc.
			</p>
			<p>
			  I could go on and on with the examples but more importantly, Is the sky
			  really falling? should we be worried about security concerns in
			  GNU/Linux? Let us discuss the valid points Madaidan has brought in the
			  table from his
			  <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html"
				>article</a
			  >
			</p>
			<h2>Sandboxing</h2>
			<h3>"Linux still follows the MS-DOS security model"</h3>
	  
			<p>
			  A rogue application on Windows and macOS can still scan a user's
			  document directory and can still download a victim's data (Even an
			  innocent teamviewer session has the potential to do this). You might
			  argue that on Windows and macOS users are warned about unsigned
			  binaries, while true that Linux does not do that (because it is useless
			  to do so) it is a non-problem on major Linux distributions because Linux
			  desktop users are encouraged to use package managers, app stores
			  maintained by Linux distros, Flathub and Snapcraft instead of running
			  random binaries on the internet.
			</p>
			<p>
			  Ofcourse I'm not discrediting Apple's App store and Windows store which
			  is also a solution for not encountering rogue applications and having
			  the apps distributed on their stores sandboxed. The main point here is
			  that Yes,
			  <b
				>Linux might still follow the MS-DOS security model but so are the
				other two major desktop operating systems</b
			  >. As for sandbox, all apps distributed under Flatpak and Snapd are
			  sandboxed by different security modules. Whether or not Flatpak and
			  Snapd have inferior sandbox implementations is up for a different
			  discussion.
