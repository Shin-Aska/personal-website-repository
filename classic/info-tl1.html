            </p>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Torchlight is a very popular hack and slash ARPG (Action Roleplaying Game)
                developed by Runic Games (Now Defunct). The game took its inspiration from Blizzard's
                Diablo series (specifically Diablo 1) where as an adventurer will be placed in the
                city of Torchlight and slowly uncover the secrets that the town holds.

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
                If you have played any ARPG game before (Diablo, Fate, TitanQuest, Grimdawn, Path of Exile)
                then Torchlight will not be unfamiliar to you. You control a single character, level it up,
                choose which abilities to progress and at the same time allocate stats for you to be able to
                wear the items you want for your build. That's basically the core gameplay of torchlight.
            </p>
            <img src="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/957477287222977086/67D443106080C608813189D7E931ED5FD70DC41B/"
                height="400" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
            <p>
                Now unlike Diablo, Titan Quest, Grimdawn and Path of Exile. Torchlight 1 is a Single player game.
                It does not offer any sort of multiplayer capabilities, such as LAN play is unavailable (which
                thankfully, Torchlight 2 offers).
                There were projects in the past that attempted to add such feature however, such efforts are now
                abandoned and was incomplete.
                So if you don't like to play alone, I don't recommend you to play Torchlight 1, unless you don't have an
                internet connection with you.
            </p>
            <p>
                The end-game is basically a dungeon randomizer with generic quests and all. There is no crafting aside
                from socketing items
                using gems. So normally you would really want to play this game if you want to trace the origins of
                Torchlight 2.

                Storywise, If you have played Diablo 1 or Fate, you might find that the "One city with a very deep
                dungeon trope"
                applies to this game. The story revolves on the city of Torchlight getting attacked by monsters that
                came from
                the mines of the said city. As the player progresses, they discover that the mines itself leads to
                different dungeons
                until it meets the end-game boss.

            <h2>Compatibility</h2>
            <p>
                During the time of its release, it was already praised for being a great time killer and very optimized.
                For low powered
                netbooks, it isn't an issue as there is even a dedicated option called the "Netbook mode" that once
                activated, reduces significantly
                the effects in the game, including lowering certain graphical options to make up for the low powered
                hardware. It should be noted that
                the Netbook mode isn't exclusive to only netbooks and can be used by Low powered computers as well.
