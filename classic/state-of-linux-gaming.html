			<h1 id="headingBlog">State of Linux Gaming in 2021</h1>
			<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

			<p>
				A decade ago, only a handful of native Linux AAA games were available in the market. The only native AAA
				game that
				I can remember back then was Amnesia, and the rest were indie games where the majority were fairly new,
				under the
				FOSS license, and made as a hobby.
			</p>

			<p>
				Tuxkart was not that visually appealing back then as most of the developments are focused on solidifying
				gameplay,
				and Wine was still at its infancy that time and can only run old games at best. Thus, many believed that
				Linux was
				not meant for gaming.
			</p>

			<figure>
				<a href="images/tuxkarto.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="preview center"
						src="images/tuxkarto_tmb.jpg"></a>
				<figcaption>Figure 1. Tuxkart version 0.6</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Now jump back to the present; a lot of things have happened. Most of the indie FOSS license games have
				become
				mature. Tuxkart development ended, and a fork continued on its place called SuperTuxKart, which is known
				as a
				solid racing time-killer game now that anyone can get for free and is visually appealing too. Did I
				forget to
				mention it has network multiplayer and up to 4-player split-screen?
			</p>

			<figure>
				<a href="images/tuxkart.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="preview center"
						src="images/tuxkart_tmb.jpg"></a>
				<figcaption>Figure 2. SuperTuxkart version 0.9.2. Massive difference in both functionality and graphics
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Then Wine started to catch up. It can now run a huge amount of Windows applications that it
				can run
				than ever before. A lot more developers have started contributing to the project, which made it possible
				for newly
				released Windows applications to begin working on Wine. Not to mention that all of these projects are
				under FOSS,
				which in turn allows extraordinary efforts such as porting these projects to other operating systems,
				which is a
				win-win for everyone.
			</p>

			<p>
				Because of Wine's maturity and potential. Valve saw the opportunity to streamline Wine to Steam and
				developed
				Proton (an integrated Wine on Steam) for Linux. They even have documentation for developers to port
				their games
				over to Linux via Proton. Proton allowed Valve to open more games to Linux users. (Case in point; I
				could even
				play Resident Evil 3 and Trials of Mana on Day 1!)
			</p>

			<figure>
				<a href="images/re3_1_wine.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="preview center"
						src="images/re3_1_wine_tmb.jpg"></a>
				<figcaption>Figure 3. Resident Evil 3, playable on release via Proton</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Although Trials of Mana did require installing Media platform framework to fix the crashing issues
				(which is a bit
				difficult to do for a beginner) and Resident Evil 3 was not finishable during the first few versions of
				Proton.
				Eventually, <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases"> Custom Proton
					builds<sup>[1]</sup></a> came in and added their custom fixes to fix these issues on that particular
				Proton
				build.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is far from perfect, and these issues are normal as the Wine community is playing the catchup for
				creating an
				unofficial compatibility layer for Windows applications. However, as you can see as well, The community,
				along
				with Valve, is doing their work pretty great and is quite fast in most cases (There are cases where it
				takes a
				while due to technical limitations like it took time for them to finally implement support for PE
				ntdll.dll, which
				is what the Street Fighter 5 DRM required to be playable)
			</p>
			<p>
				I know why you are here, though. I or somebody else linked you to this article to get more details
				regarding the
				state of Linux gaming and is considering switching or go all-in on Linux possible. However, I will not
				try to
				convince you, but I will discuss the technical achievements that allowed Linux gaming to become what it
				is today,
				in 2021.
			</p>
			<h2 id="overall_state_of_wine">Overall State of Wine</h2>
			<h3>Existence of superior graphical translation layers</h3>
			<figure>
				<a href="images/hw_render.drawio.png" target="_blank"><img class="preview center"
						src="images/hw_render.drawio.png" style="width: 100% !important"></a>
				<figcaption>Figure 4. Architecture diagram of how Wine translated a Direct3D call
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				To make it possible for DirectX games to run on Wine. A translation layer is needed as DirectX is exclusive to
				Windows only. For example, Wine translates Direct3D calls to OpenGL calls. This translation is not the best
				approach as Direct3D and OpenGL have different fundamental concepts and because of this, performance overheads are
				inenvitable because not all DirectX calls have a 1-to-1 equivalent with OpenGL.
			</p>
			<p>
				As OpenGL specifications improve over time, the performance penalty should improve as the newer features that each
				new iterations introduce could help even the gap of the conceptual differences between OpenGL and Direct3D.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, no matter how much you look at it, OpenGL may be simpler to code but it has been shown time and time again
				how Direct3D outperforms OpenGL because Direct3D allows finer lower level control in comparison to OpenGL. This may seem
				a hindrance to Wine's compatibility progress but two translation layers appeared and changed Linux gaming for good.
			</p>
			<p>
				These are Gallium9 and DXVK. Gallium9 is a native implementation of D3D via Mesa. The native
				implementation of
				Direct3D calls from Mesa removes the extra step of translating D3D calls to OpenGL calls. Most GPU calls
				are done
				directly at a driver level, which provides a significant performance improvement.
			</p>
			<p>
				DXVK is another approach where instead of relying on Mesa, it translates D3D calls to Vulkan. Vulkan is
				a
				low-level, high-performance, cross-platform graphics API that allows developers to access a GPU's raw
				hardware
				power. In contrast to OpenGL, which is simplified, so there is more potential for writing a faster
				translation
				layer in Vulkan over OpenGL.
			</p>
			<p>
				DXVK supports D3D as a whole (Originally only supporting DX10 and 11, but DX9VK is now part of DXVK,
				which allowed
				DXVK to support DX9 as well), While Gallium9 is exclusively for D3D9.
			</p>
			<p>
				These new translation layers are far from perfect; however, they allow more Linux games than ever before
				at
				slightly less performance impact. However, just like the introduction story earlier. It will improve and
				mature
				over time allowing more software to be run on Linux and possibly other platforms.
			</p>

			<figure>
				<a href="images/rendering_issue_megaman_2.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="preview center"
						src="images/rendering_issue_megaman_2_tmb.jpg"></a>
				<figcaption>Figure 5. Rendering issue for Megaman Legacy Collection 2 due to DXVK incorrect translation
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				For example, the rendering issues for MMLC2 is fixed on a later version of DXVK which means that MMLC2
				is now
				playable on Linux. But there will be games (or future newer titles) that will encounter similar issues.
			</p>
			<h3>Mediaplatform support</h3>
			<p>
				Media Foundation/DirectShow/Media Platform are APIs provided by Microsoft to embed rich user media such
				as videos
				(for cutscenes), audio in a variety of formats, including those under encryption via DRM.
			</p>
			<p>
				Originally the potential fix for this was to install Media foundation platform SDK (Mfplat) on your
				targetted Wine
				prefix, and it might work (Since there is still software that refuses to run even with this type of
				hack). Not to
				mention we are walking to a thin-ice/grey area here because of the implicated legality in Microsoft's
				EULA, it is
				not legal to provide this level of support out of the box, and the user is left on their own to apply
				this.
			</p>
			<p>
				Starting in Wine 6.0, we now have proper Media platform support out of the box using clean-room reverse
				engineering efforts, allowing more games to run out of the box that utilizes Media foundation platform.
			</p>
			<h3>DRM Support and Anticheat</h3>
			<p>
				These are some of the real problems that Wine is facing right now. Many software, especially under the AAA game
				section, have DRMs and anti-cheats incompatible with Wine because most of the DRMs and Anticheats directly use the
				NT Kernel instead of interacting with the Win32API.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since Wine is a translation layer of Win32API calls to GNU/Linux calls, when software running on Wine will
				attempt to do a system call on the NT Kernel, Wine will communicate with the Linux Kernel instead and since
				the Linux kernel does not understand what the NT kernel system call does, it will provide an incorrect response
				causing the DRM module or Anticheat to fail.
			</p>
			<p>
				Of course, there are many ways to fix this; currently, Wine developers will translate the NT Kernel calls without
				sending a system call directly to the kernel. Quite a hacky approach on solving the problem, This is also one of
				the reasons why there is massive influx of custom Wine forks that aim to be compatible with a specific game or DRM.
			</p>
			<p>
				Of course, there are many ways to fix this; currently, Wine developers will translate the NT Kernel

				sending a system call directly to the kernel. Quite a hacky approach to solving the problem, which
				caused a
				massive influx of custom Wine forks that aim to be compatible with a specific game or DRM.
			</p>
			<p>
				With Linux Kernel 5.11, there is now syscall_user_dispatch that lets the kernel send back unsupported
				system calls
				back to userspace, which will help standardize this effort. The new kernel feature is not the silver
				bullet, but
				it should help make things manageable now without thousands of forks popping in.
			</p>
			<p>
				Valve is trying to provide better Proton support for DRMs, especially for single-player games by nature.
				However,
				for Anticheat/Multiplayer games, we are still out of luck. So if you are playing a multiplayer game
				using Easy
				Anticheat, such as Fall guys, where the game was playable on Day 1 but became incompatible because the
				Easy
				Anticheat integration on a later update.
			</p>
			<h3>Overall Compatibility</h3>

			<figure>
				<a href="images/teso_1_wine.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="preview center"
						src="images/teso_1_wine_tmb.jpg"></a>
				<figcaption>Figure 6. Elder Scrolls Online, a playable MMORPG on Proton despite being a Windows only
					game on
					Steam.</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Naturally, one will think that the latest version is always better. The reality is farther from the
				truth.
				Although most updates help improve general compatibility or even fix bugs, regressions exist, breaking
				the
				compatibility of a previously working game. Because of these regressions, certain applications or games
				are
				recommended to be run on a specific Wine version.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thankfully it is possible to have multiple versions of Wine installed in a user's system. Thanks to
				launchers such
				as Lutris and Play on Linux, they have existing configurations that allow you to run/install
				applications with
				minimal effort on the user's end.
			</p>
			<p>
				Not to mention Steam also allows you to run and configure to use specific versions of Proton (including
				Custom
				Proton forks such as Proton-TKG and Proton-GE) on a per-game basis.
			</p>
			<p>
				In general, we can say that Wine compatibility has been doing great. But it is not yet on the level of
				super
				user-friendliness. Even with Valve's Proton, one may end up applying hacks or installing custom Proton
				builds to
				make a game run. With <a href="https://www.winehq.org/"> WineHQ<sup>[2]</sup></a> and <a
					href="https://www.protondb.com/"> ProtonDB<sup>[3]</sup></a>, there is a global database of what
				runs and what
				does not and what hacks are needed for a program to run properly. But if you do not like this type of
				setting, I'm
				afraid Linux is not for you yet.
			</p>

				<figcaption>Figure 7. A Plague Tale - Innocence: Another triple-A game playable via Proton</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Honestly, I admit it can be a hassle, but the trade-off here is that I have more control over my
				computer. There
				is no need for me to accommodate and install powerful hardware because of the Windows bloat that later
				versions of
				Windows have.
			</p>

			<p>
				I do not need to worry that while I am playing a game, suddenly the game turns to a crawl because, for
				some
				reason, the telemetry & compatibility service decides to do its own thing, competing for resources with
				the game I
				am playing.
			</p>

			<p>
				I mean, sure, you can do unofficial tweak Windows to the point where these bloat are entirely removed,
				but there
				are consequences in here. For one, it is unsupported, thus, updates can make or break the tweak or the
				entire
				system as a whole.
			</p>
			<p>
				So for me, I would rather go for Linux, which has less bloat in general (or no bloat at all), and just
				tweak the
				translation layer until it could support the game well enough to be playable on the said system.
			</p>

			<h2 id="state_of_native_games">State of Native games</h2>
			<figure>
				<a href="images/eve_1_wine.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="preview center"
						src="images/eve_1_wine_tmb.jpg"></a>
				<figcaption>Figure 8. EverSpace - One of the games that has a native Linux port</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Despite Wine being the main spotlight in Linux gaming lately (due to it allowing to access more Windows
				applications), there has been increasing traction of Linux native ports, especially on the Indie
				section. Not to
				mention that have been online games too that slowly added native Linux support.
			</p>
			<p>
				Examples are Valheim and Skul the hero slayer; both are popular games right now.
			</p>
			<h3>The rise popularity of AppImages</h3>
			<p>
				If Windows has static linked executables, MacOS has standalone executables, Linux has AppImages.
				AppImages are
				like standalone executables. You don't have to install it on the system; you can just run it after
				downloading it.
				All the necessary files are packed in a single container. No need to install dependencies; it just
				works.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have seen many companies supporting it lately, such as Artix Games using AppImages on their Game
				Launcher,
				OnlyOffice distributing AppImages. This is great because developers do not want to adopt Linux due to
				its
				fragmented ecosystem, and now AppImage is one of the solutions for that.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you have not visited the Goodies section of this site. Most games I have linked there for Linux are
				distributed
				under AppImage. Just download the file, store it on a flash disk storage, and then execute it.
			</p>
			<h4>Flatpak and Snap, the other answers</h4>
			<p>
				These are other answers to software distribution. Flatpak and Snap are somewhat similar, although they
				differ in
				implementation technicalities.
			</p>
			<p>
				The key difference between Flatpak and Snap is its sandboxing protocol. Flatpak uses Namespaces while
				Snap uses
				AppArmor. Redhat mainly develops Flatpak while Snap is Canonical.
			</p>
			<p>
				Snap has the most hosted applications among the three, but some are not hosted in Snap but are available
				in others
				such as Flatpak or AppImage.
			</p>
			<figure>
				<a href="images/frogatto.jpeg" target="_blank"><img class="preview center"
						src="images/frogatto_tmb.jpeg"></a>
				<figcaption>Figure 9. Frogatto - One of the indie games available on several Linux distro repositories
					for free
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				With that being said, AppImages, Flatpak, and Snap are just means for developers to effectively
				distribute their
				applications outside of using package files that may end up different per Linux distribution due to
				dependency
				conflict issues. For example, I am using Ubuntu 18.04.5 and will stay here until 2023, but the Glibc
				library I am
				using is far lower than what 20.04 offers, which will be a lot of trouble on applications that require a
				higher
				version of Glibc.
			</p>
			<p>
				I do not need to worry about it anymore with the said methods above. I do not need to worry about
				breaking old
				software compatibility since I do not need to force myself to customize my Ubuntu 18.04.5 even further
				to use a
				newer version of glibc!r to use a newer version of glibc!
			</p>
			<p>
				Currently, there are a lot of applications already distributed using either of the three. Snap has been
				the most
				common one, and Flatpak being the second. AppImages vary since there is no consolidated storage or front
				for it (I
				know AppImageHub exists); thus, it is left to the developer to distribute their app using AppImage.
			</p>


			<h2 id="should_i_make_the_switch">Should I make the switch?</h2>
			<p>
				Now the real question. Should you? If your current setup is working fine, and you are happy with Windows
				as it is.
				Then don't. I will only recommend switching if, for example, you dislike the direction Microsoft is
				doing with
				Windows, or you are considering Linux because you are building a new machine and do not want to spend
				money on an
				extra windows license. (Which I greatly emphasize also to research the hardware that you are going to
				use on your
				new build as not all hardware are fully compatible with Linux)
			</p>


			<p>
				If you are not much into online gaming, then you may want to take a look and venture it (as long as you
				understand
				that not all games run via proton work perfectly and you will need the time and willingness to tinker to
				make it
				work). On the other hand, if the online games you wish to play or currently playing is well known to be
				supported
				in Wine (see Figure 6 for an example, then that is another point to consider for a switch.
			</p>

			<p>
				Here are some of the MMO games that I play that has native Linux clients.
			</p>

			</figure>

			<p>
				Suppose you are the type of gamer that wants to try the latest multiplayer games. Then it is going to be
				a hit or
				miss. If it does work, there is a chance that the developers will outright ban you just because you are
				running on
				an unsupported platform, which is the case for a <a
					href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/dcu7pb/bungie_will_permanently_ban_anyone_who_plays/">couple
					of
					Linux gamers playing Destiny being banned permanently for "cheating"<sup>[4]</sup></a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The takeaway here is I am more of a flexible gamer. I have a lot of games in my library, and thus, if
				one game
				will not work for me, I switch to another game. I am more into single-player games these days as it
				allows me to
				pause whenever I need to do something else important.
			</p>

			<h2 id="update_july_5_2021"> Update: July 5, 2021 (Provided video recordings in a form of links)</h2>
			<p>
				As of this writing, I have bought in a total of three newly released games on Steam. These are: Guilty
				Gear
				-Strive-, Scarlet Nexus and Legends of Mana. These games do not have native Linux ports and since I
				mainly game on
				Linux it was purely a risk in my end.
			</p>
			<p>
				To my surprise, Guilty Gear -Strive- worked out of the box on day 1. It has some issues like movement
				demonstration videos not playing but the core game including multiplayer worked great! <a
					target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/indGn-UrroU"><sup>[YT]</sup></a> <a target="_blank"
					href="videos/linux_proton_strive.mp4"><sup>[LC]</sup></a> Scarlet Nexus too worked on day 1 and did

					target="_blank" href="videos/linux_proton_scarlet.mp4"><sup>[LC]</sup></a>. Legends of Mana actually
				ran and was able to play
				for the first few minutes but is considered unplayable because it freezes randomly every so often
				(probably due to
				Denuvo) <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/Pru0qSgH1yA"><sup>[YT]</sup></a> <a target="_blank"
					href="videos/linux_proton_lom.mp4"><sup>[LC]</sup></a>. To be fair, the steam port for Legend of
				Mana is a bit
				of problematic anyways due to it having slow down issues that the PS4 and Switch versions do not have.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a Resident Evil fan, I did not purchase nor tried out Resident Evil 8 (Village) [because Resident
				Evil 7 is
				still in my backlog]. Although I am aware of its history in terms of playability status in Proton.
				Originally it
				did not play well because of Denuvo (which was apparent on the demo) but for a couple of weeks later,
				the Proton
				community was able to forge in a patch to make the game playable hence obtaining the Gold rating now. I
				mean as
				long as its a very popular game, eventually somebody is bound to be able to fix the underlying issues of
				Wine to
				be able to make the game playable.
			</p>
			<h2 id="update_october_11_2021">Update: October 11, 2021</h2>
			<p>
				Valve has recently made efforts to make Wine/Proton be compatible with several industry standard
				Anticheat & DRM
				software
				for their upcoming Steam deck hardware which also resulted in <a
					href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690670/epic-eac-anti-cheat-linux-valve-steam-deck-support-games">
					Epic Games adding an expansion roadmap for supporting Proton and Wine via their EasyAntiCheat while
					BattleEye
					promises to
					have it support on its way<sup>[5]</sup></a>.
				Unfortunately there is a significant effort that is needed for developers to tweak with their Anticheat
				and DRM
				solutions
				so it might not be a total instant fix but atleast it is a start.
			</p>

			<h2 id="update_jan_5_2022">Update: January 5, 2022</h2>

			<p>
				Several people have asked whether I have seen the <a
					href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0506yDSgU7M">latest
					Linus tech tips series about Linux gaming<sup>[6]</sup></a>. Their 4 part video indeed shows the
				reality
				about Linux gaming. That is, it does work; you can get yourself entertained gaming on Linux.
			</p>

			<p>
				Although that might sound different from the title of the video's finale, you must understand that it
				takes to
				consider that most of the video focuses on the typical gamer perspective, which is Luke's perspective.
			</p>

			<p>
				Linus and I's experience are similar, and thus, we both have the same perspective since we both are
				flexible in our gaming experience.
			</p>

			<p>
				That being said, it aligns with my conclusion. If you are fine with Windows. Stick with Windows. If you
				want to
				explore Linux, you can freely do so on a virtual machine or use Windows-Subsystem for Linux. Gaming on
				Linux will
				take a commitment that will not be an attractive venture to most.
