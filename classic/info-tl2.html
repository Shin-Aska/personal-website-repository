            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Torchlight 2 is a contiunation of the very popular hack and slash ARPG (Action Roleplaying Game)
                series developed by Runic Games (Now Defunct). The core gameplay remains untouched but the game
                now offers new classes, moddable content and the long awaited multiplayer.
            </p>

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
                If you have played any ARPG game before (Diablo, Fate, TitanQuest, Grimdawn, Path of Exile)
                then Torchlight 2 will not be unfamiliar to you. You control a single character, level it up,
                choose which abilities to progress and at the same time allocate stats for you to be able to
                wear the items you want for your build. That's basically the core gameplay of torchlight. In addition
                if you have played Torchlight 1 before playing this game, you might find that the game is all too
                familiar
                with the difference is now the game offers a different set of classes that the predecessor offers.
            </p>

                height="400" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
            <p>
                It feels like how the story was laid out is similar to Diablo the series. Where in the first game,
                you're stuck
                in Tristram, exploring the corrupted chapel, and then in the 2nd game, you get the chance to explore the
                different
                cities that where only mention in the game. Why did I make such a comparison? because this game is just
                like that.
                In Torchlight 1, you are stuck in the city of Torchlight and left exploring the mines until it lead to a
                series of dungeons,
                in Torchlight 2, you are now roaming around different regions of the game. Sounds all too familiar eh?
            </p>

                height="400" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
            <p>
                Anyways, story isn't all too important in an ARPG game, because all that matters is just kill-kill-kill
                (or Grind-Grind-Grind).
                The end game of Torchlight 2 is a very big improvement in comparison to its predecessor. In Torchlight
                2, you now have Mapworks.
                Mapworks are pre-generated randomized maps similar to how Path of Exile's end game maps work (except
                Torchlight is the original).
                You start out first with very bland and generic Maps which in turn drops more challenging Maps that
                contains strong bosses and ofcourse
                better loot.
            </p>
            <h2>Compatibility</h2>
            <p>
                The graphical capabilities of the game engine itself remains untouched, with the biggest
                changes is the multiplayer aspect of the game. It no longer has the Netbook mode available
                in the options, but changing all settings to low produces similar performance results.
            </p>
