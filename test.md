# Using ChatGPT vs Gemini


## Introduction

I recently participated in a company hackathon where the challenge was to create a work-related system incorporating AI. My goal was to develop a deep learning neural network for a new feature in our system. Since the feature was new, we needed to generate training data. Given the tight three-day timeframe, we utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce thousands of data points, which we then manually pruned.

During this data generation phase, my colleagues and I had a productive discussion comparing ChatGPT Plus and Gemini Pro. I've been using ChatGPT Plus for several months, but a friend suggested that Gemini Pro might be better suited for our development and coding tasks. This conversation sparked an idea.

Why not try Gemini Pro for a month and see how it performs? After all, I'm always looking for ways to streamline my work, and if switching LLM providers can enhance my productivity, I'm willing to give it a shot.

In this article, I will share my experience using Gemini Pro for one month and compare it to my experience with ChatGPT Plus. I conducted this experiment while my ChatGPT Plus subscription was still active (until June 10), which allowed me to make a direct comparison between the two platforms before transitioning exclusively to Gemini Pro.

Before we begin, though, I am quite aware of other LLM providers such as Anthropic, and I have actually tried them in the past as well. Although the claim that one LLM produces better code than another is subjective, I do not primarily use LLMs to generate entire codebases, but rather just snippets when needed. I mostly use LLMs at work to proofread what I have wrote, or to generate or convert code from one format to another (such as converting JSON data to a Mermaid Diagram), so I will be reflecting on my experience based on that.

Granted, I also use ChatGPT for a little creative work. Specifically, for generating avatars from an old-school game I play named Fallen Sword, and occasionally to help friends create 10-15 second videos for their Dungeons & Dragons scenarios. I will also include these creative features that the two offer in my comparison.
