    <!-- Chosen Palette: Parchment & Ink -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as a tabbed interface to mirror a player's typical progression and information-seeking behavior. It's divided into five main sections: 'The Avatar's Path' (character setup), 'The Grand Quest' (walkthrough), 'Britannian Almanac' (data reference), 'World Atlas' (dungeons), and 'Sage's Counsel' (AI-powered help). This non-linear structure allows users to either follow the quest chronologically or quickly look up specific information. Interactive charts, filterable tables, and two new Gemini API features‚Äîan AI backstory generator and a strategic advisor‚Äîprovide dynamic, personalized content. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Character Virtues: Report Info -> Starting attribute bonuses. Goal -> Allow players to plan their character build. Viz/Method -> Interactive bar chart (Chart.js). Interaction -> Hovering over bars shows precise stat bonuses. Justification -> A chart is more engaging and easier to compare than a static table.
        - Companion Roster: Report Info -> Companion stats and roles. Goal -> Help players build their ideal party. Viz/Method -> A filterable and sortable HTML table. Interaction -> Users can sort by STR, DEX, INT, or Level. Justification -> An interactive table is superior to a static list for comparing multiple attributes.
        - Quest Walkthrough: Report Info -> Linear steps for major quests. Goal -> Guide players through the game's narrative. Viz/Method -> Accordion-style collapsible sections. Interaction -> Clicking a quest title expands to show the detailed steps. Justification -> Prevents overwhelming the user with a wall of text.
        - AI Backstory Generator (Gemini): Goal -> Enhance roleplaying immersion. Viz/Method -> Button-triggered text generation. Interaction -> User selects virtues and clicks a button. Justification -> Creates personalized, creative content that connects the player to their character.
        - AI Strategic Advisor (Gemini): Goal -> Provide dynamic, on-demand help. Viz/Method -> Text input and response display. Interaction -> User types a question and receives a detailed, contextual answer. Justification -> Offers a more interactive and flexible help system than a static FAQ or walkthrough.
