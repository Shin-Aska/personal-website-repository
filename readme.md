Introduction
============

This repository is the source code for my personal website, www.richardorilla.website. 
The website is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are some tidbits of PHP, mostly
for security purposes (such as nonce) and some header related items but they are not really important.

Heck you can host this using Python's http-server and it will not really matter üòÅ
