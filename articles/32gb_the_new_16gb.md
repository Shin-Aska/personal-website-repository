# Do We Need More RAM? Is 32GB the New 16GB?

## Introduction

As we head toward 2026, many of us are eyeing system upgrades to stay ahead of the curve. I’m in the same boat. I had plans to boost my workstation from 32GB to 64GB of RAM, but with the AI boom, memory prices have skyrocketed as data centers snap up all the supply.

This price jump hits enthusiasts and gamers like me right in the wallet. Even with 32GB, I often find myself wanting 64GB to juggle Podman containers, virtual machines, and daily apps without breaking a sweat.

I’m writing this on my Surface Pro 8, which has 16GB of RAM. It’s still a solid device, but it doesn’t feel like the “high-end” machine it once was. So, here’s the big question for 2026: **Is 32GB the new 16GB?** Are we at the point where 16GB is just the bare minimum for entry-level setups?

## Software Bloat: The "Electron" Tax

It’s no secret that today’s apps are bloated. I remember running Winamp back in 2007, using less than 70MB of RAM when 256MB was standard. Now, Spotify can easily chew through over a gigabyte. What gives?

The main issue is the reliance on browser wrappers like Electron. Developers prioritize speed and cross-platform support over efficiency, so instead of native code for Windows or Linux, they bundle a full web browser with the app.

That’s a hefty memory cost. Run Spotify, Signal, Discord, and Viber at once, and you’re basically running four separate browsers, each with its own overhead. In this scenario, 16GB of RAM gets eaten up fast.

## The Shift to Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)

Luckily, there’s a promising trend: Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). As browser tech improves, PWAs let us run apps more efficiently without the burden of multiple standalone browser instances.

I’m hopeful about this change. Major platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp are refining their PWAs. Netflix had a rocky start as Windows users lost offline downloads and yet YouTube proves that feature-packed PWAs can work well by offering such feature to Youtube Premium users.

I’ve switched from the Spotify desktop app to the YouTube Music PWA, and it’s been a smoother ride with much lower memory use.

This efficiency can extend the life of older hardware. I still use a 2015 MacBook Air for everyday tasks, running Chrome OS Flex. Since the OS integrates tightly with PWAs, I can manage messengers (Viber/Signal via Lacros), JetBrains IDEs, and media apps on just 8GB of RAM. It shows that optimized software can reduce the need for constant hardware upgrades.

## Gaming: Optimization vs. Brute Force

Gaming, however, is a different story. The demand for RAM is real. Not only do we need more VRAM for graphics, but system RAM requirements are steadily climbing toward 32GB for top performance.

The industry often seems to rely on hardware to cover for software shortcomings. Take *Borderlands 4*. It struggles even on solid mid-tier setups. When performance issues come up, responses from folks like Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford often suggest players just accept their hardware limits rather than expect better optimization.

There’s a heated debate about Unreal Engine 5. Is the engine itself unoptimized, or are developers not using it properly? I lean toward developers bearing a lot of the responsibility. Look at *Armored Core 6*, built on Unreal Engine 4. it runs beautifully even on a GTX 1050Ti, showing that optimization is a choice.

On the other hand, Larian Studios did a fantastic job with *Baldur’s Gate 3*, optimizing a demanding game for the Steam Deck. Yet, these well-optimized titles are becoming outliers. As AAA games increasingly list 16GB as a *minimum*, 32GB is starting to feel like the safe bet for serious gaming.

## Day-to-Day Usage vs. Power Users

For casual users, not much has shifted. Despite software bloat, 16GB is still adequate for browsing, streaming, and light office tasks. I don’t see an urgent push for everyday folks to jump to 32GB yet.

But for power users managing 20+ tabs alongside creative or development tools, 8GB is outdated, and 16GB is starting to feel restrictive. If memory is a constraint, there are workarounds. take a look at my guide on the [Firefox Unlimited Tabs Setup](firefox-unlimited-tabs-setup.html) for tips on stretching browser resources.

## Conclusion

So, is 32GB the new 16GB?

From where I stand, we’re in a transitional phase. For gamers, developers, and power users, **32GB is the new standard for comfort and future-proofing.** Relying on 16GB in 2026 for high-performance tasks feels like a limitation.

Yet, for the average user, the shift isn’t fully here. With component shortages and high RAM prices, the industry might hold off on making 32GB the baseline for budget devices. Still, if you’re building a PC today with a five-year lifespan in mind, 32GB is the logical choice.
