# Baldurs Gate 3 and Game Standards

## Introduction


 Baldur's Gate 3 was released just two weeks ago and has enjoyed a tremendously successful launch.
 It has garnered widespread praise from fans, earning highly favorable reviews and claiming the top 
 spot on Steam charts. Personally, even after spending nearly 50 hours immersed in the game (mainly on weekends),
 I can confidently echo the sentiment that this is an exceptional game. It's safe to say that it stands as a
 strong contender for the Game of the Year award at the upcoming gaming awards.
 


 However, as is often the case with success, it's accompanied by a fair share of controversy.
 In particular, there has been a growing drama surrounding AAA game developers expressing concerns about setting
 Baldur's Gate 3 as the new standard, citing various "reasons."
 These reasons include factors such as budgeting and time constraints that Larian Studios did not encounter during development.
