## Introduction

Although majority of the contents on this websites are created from scratch without using frameworks, I did use existing open source libraries or even services to host this website. For transparency purposes and give credit where credit is due. This page is entirely dedicated to listing down all of the libraries and services that I have used that did not came from me.

## Libraries

The following is the list of libraries that I have used on this website. I have categorize them into two sections. The javascript and non-javascript section.

This is to easily identify which libraries are being used on these specific versions. To be clear when I say javascript, I am referring to [www.richardorilla.website<sup>[1]</sup>](www.richardorilla.website) 

Whereas for non-javascript, I am referring to the subsite of this domain which is [classic.richardorilla.website<sup>[2]</sup>]( classic.richardorilla.website).

Furthermore, the list also has a description of what it is and how it is used.

### Javascript

1. [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - Mainly used for the $(document).ready() function. Which for non-programmers means this Javascript code will be executed after the page is done loading. Is use is seen in this [site.js file](https://github.com/Shin-Aska/personal-website-repository/blob/e20f3223643d6a4b8ec7fa2b5820aad58d49d7a9/default/script/site.js#L25). Currently still using 1.10 (very outdated) but I may update this soon
2. [jQuery UI](https://jqueryui.com/) - A partner for jQuery. Mainly used for Datatables plugin and nothing else.
3. [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) - Mainly used in the [blog.html page](https://github.com/Shin-Aska/personal-website-repository/blob/e20f3223643d6a4b8ec7fa2b5820aad58d49d7a9/default/blog.html#L370) however is used on other pages as well such as the [Browser-based games in the modern internet blog article <sup>[js]</sup>](https://www.richardorilla.website/browser-gaming.html). Basically I use this to make a table that is sortable and searchable so any future pages that will use tables will be using this.
4. [Three.js](https://threejs.org) - Javascript 3d library. I mainly use this for the animated background in the javascript version of the site.
5. [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) - Mainly for code highlighting. 

### Non-javascript

Currently I do not use any external libraries for the non-javascript version.

## Services

The site itself uses a few services to enhance the availability of the site. Some of these are already highlighted/covered in the [privacy policy page](privacy-policy.html) of this website.

1. [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) - Mainly use Cloudflare as a CDN. I set it up in a way that allows TOR and VPN connections in my site considering my website is mostly static content anyways.

## Applications

Currently the only applications this site uses are offline applications. Specifically when writing new or editing webpages on this site. Here are the following offline applications that I use for writing content on this website.

1. [Typora](https://typora.io/) - I mainly use this to write markdown files for my website and then convert it to html using my web page generator
2. [PDF Studio](https://www.qoppa.com/pdfstudio/) - Mainly used for embedding PDF files into web pages without using the browser's PDF reader. I use this on my [resume page](resume.html) for example.
