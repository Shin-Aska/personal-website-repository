description: multi-agent planning via claude opus 4.6 with budget executors
auto_execution_mode: 0
---

## Overview
Use this workflow when you want **Claude Opus 4.6** to design the overall plan, then hand off execution to **budget models**.

Because the executor models are less "high thinking", the plan must be **more granular, explicit, and file-path-oriented**.

The key requirement: **Claude must output a Markdown checkbox plan** (not prose) that you can execute phase-by-phase with other agents.

This workflow is **plan-only**: it must end after writing the plan to `plan.md`. Execution happens in a separate workflow.

## Steps
1. **Collect current context**
   - Summarize the problem, repo state, constraints, and desired deliverables.
   - Include:
     - Primary user-facing behavior changes
     - Target files/areas if known
     - Testing requirements (unit/integration/manual)
     - Any performance or UX constraints
2. **Open a planning session with Claude Opus 4.6**
   - Feed the context above plus the agent roster below.
   - Use the **copy/paste prompt template** below.
   - Do not accept Claude’s answer unless it matches the required checkbox format.
3. **Review and finalize the plan**
   - Sanity-check ordering, dependencies, and that tasks are small enough for budget models.
   - Ensure each phase has:
     - Concrete file paths
     - Concrete outputs
     - Validation steps
   - Lock the plan before delegating work.
4. **Write the plan to `plan.md` (repo root)**
   - Save Claude’s output verbatim into `plan.md`.
   - Ensure the plan is Markdown with checkboxes.
5. **Stop**
   - Do not execute any phases in this workflow.
   - Next: run the `/execute-plan` workflow to execute the next phase (or a user-specified phase).

## Claude Opus prompt template (budget-mode, stricter)
Copy/paste the following into Claude Opus 4.6. Replace the bracketed sections.

```text
You are the PLANNER. Produce an EXECUTION PLAN that will be carried out by multiple specialized agents (budget models).

Hard requirements (must follow exactly):
1) Output MUST be Markdown.
2) Output MUST be a checkbox plan, with tasks using literal "- [ ]" checkboxes (no bullets without checkboxes).
3) Plan MUST be split into numbered Phases (Phase 1, Phase 2, ...).
4) Every Phase MUST specify exactly one assigned agent from the roster (not Opus), except a final "QA / Integration" phase which can be Claude Opus 4.6.
   4a) Distribute execution across multiple non-Claude agents (use at least 2 different executor agents across the phases).
5) Budget-model constraint: keep each checklist item small and explicit.
   - Each task must be independently actionable and verifiable.
   - Prefer tasks that touch 1-3 files.
   - Include file paths, function/component names, and exact behavior changes.
6) Every Phase MUST include (in this exact order):
   - **Agent:** <one from roster>
   - **Goal:** (1-2 sentences)
   - **Context for Agent:** what to read first + invariants/constraints
   - **Tasks:** checklist items using the exact format: "- [ ] **N.M** <imperative verb> ... (Files: ... )"
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** checklist
   - **Validation:** explicit commands (if applicable) + manual verification steps
7) Include a "Risks / Edge Cases" section as a checklist (so we can track mitigations).
8) Include a Dependency Graph section and a Recommended Execution Order table.
9) Include a Handoff Prompts section: for each Phase, provide a one-line message I can paste into the assigned agent, e.g. "Run /execute-plan Phase 3".
10) No vague tasks like "improve" or "polish". Replace them with concrete UI/behavior changes.
11) Every phase must only be assign to one agent. You cannot have multiple agents working on the same phase (that also means you cannot have subtasks assigned to different agents)

Project context:
[PASTE CONTEXT HERE]

Agent roster (choose from these):
- Claude Sonnet 4.6 (implementation + smaller refactors)
- GPT-5.2-Codex (coding-heavy tasks, refactors, tests)
- Gemini 3 Pro (UI components, styling/theming)
- Kimi K2.5 (UX polish, shortcuts/clipboard/accessibility, well-scoped implementation)

Now produce the plan.
```

## Agent roster & expertise
- **Claude Opus 4.6 (Planner only)**: Produces the checkbox execution plan; no coordination, QA, or integration duties.
- **Claude Sonnet 4.6**: Leads coordination between executors, handles implementation + smaller refactors, and owns final review/integration checklists when assigned.
- **GPT-5.2-Codex**: Coding-heavy tasks, refactors, tests, complex code modifications with clear specs.
- **Gemini 3 Pro**: UI/UX component generation, widget libraries, styling/theming.
- **Kimi K2.5**: UX polish, shortcuts/clipboard flows, accessibility, well-scoped implementation.

## Handoff tips
- Keep a running checklist of completed subtasks and outstanding ones.
- When briefing budget models, paste:
  - The Phase section verbatim
  - Any relevant file excerpts
  - The acceptance criteria they must satisfy
- Note blocking issues immediately so Opus can replan if necessary.

## Completion criteria
- Every plan step has an assigned agent, recorded outcome, and validation notes.
- Code/tests/docs are merged or staged per plan.
- Outstanding risks are documented for the next planning cycle.
