			<h3>Description:</h3>
			<p>
				I'm a person who loves to code and play games (In general, not just computer games). I love
				to twiddle around and try to understand things and self improvement is one of my goals. In
				terms of hobbies, I love to play the violin (I'm not that good though), draw (Rarely now),
				stare at the sky, eagles (They're awesome, nuff said) and finally socialize with people on 
				the arcade centers (My favorite and been doing it since 2008).
			</p>

			<p>
				I have been developing web applications since early 2011, although I had projects that involved
				other technologies such as Java and C# but I rarely had them now. I never had real work
				experience with regards to C++ however, I did have personal projects that had involved
				with that.
			</p>

			<p>
				Unfortunately, I only have a few to show. But that's because most of the jobs I have where
				freelance and I deeply uphold the client confidentiality which is why I don't have much to
				show because I usually delete my old projects from my clients. Some are also confidential
				by nature. Although it's kinda sad I can't show off that much but I hope my existing projects
				(All of them are personal) can be somewhat believable.
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				Skills:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Proficient in: C++, C#, Java,Javascript, PHP and VB.net
				<li>Familiar with: Frameworks such as Mootools, Qt, .Net and to some extent RoR (I know Ruby but I'm not proficient at it)
				<li>Database: MySQL server, Microsoft SQL server, Access and DB2
			</ul>
